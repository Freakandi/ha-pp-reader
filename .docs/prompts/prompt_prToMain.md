You are my coding assistant. I need you to prepare a pull request that merges the current `dev` branch into `main`.

Before running any scripts, perform the following verification steps:
1. Confirm that the integration manifest(s) (e.g., `custom_components/pp_reader/manifest.json`) have their `version` field set to the latest version number that appears in the top entry of `CHANGELOG.md`.
2. If the manifest version and the latest changelog version do not match, report this mismatch, state explicitly that this is a blocking issue, and DO NOT execute any scripts.

If the manifest version matches the latest changelog version, proceed with the release preparation workflow:
1. Check out the `dev` branch (or confirm it is already checked out), prune the worktree if necessary, and ensure it is up to date.
2. Create a fresh feature branch from this pruned `dev` worktree so that the subsequent changes can be committed in an isolated branch that will back the PR.
3. Execute `scripts/prepare_main_pr.sh` so that only the intended content is promoted from `dev` to `main` within this feature branch.
4. Collect all necessary details to describe the PR content, including notable changes, tests, or release notes generated by the script.
5. Immediately draft the pull request targeting `main` from the new feature branch unless a blocking issue occurs during any of the steps above.

After completing the above, provide me with:
- A clear statement confirming whether the manifest version validation passed.
- A summary of the steps performed, explicitly mentioning that `scripts/prepare_main_pr.sh` was executed (or not executed if blocked) and that a feature branch plus PR to `main` were created when no blockers were found.
- The finalized PR title and body that I can use for the `dev` to `main` promotion.
