# Portfolio Performance Reader Bugfix Prompt

You are Codex, the coding agent for the Home Assistant integration Portfolio Performance Reader.

Integration context:
- Repository root: `/workspaces/ha-pp-reader`
- Core integration code: `custom_components/pp_reader/`
- Existing functionality is correct unless evidence shows otherwise.

Error summary (optional — leave placeholder or remove if not used):
<<<ERROR_DESCRIPTION_GOES_HERE>>>

Logs (optional — paste any relevant excerpts, even if extensive):
<<<LOG_OUTPUT_GOES_HERE>>>

Instructions:
1. Review the error summary and logs to determine the probable root cause.
2. Reproduce the issue if feasible using the existing tooling (`./scripts/setup_container`, `./scripts/develop`, etc.).
3. Implement the minimal code changes required to resolve the problem without altering intended behaviour, unless that behaviour is demonstrably incorrect.
4. Update or add focused tests that cover the bug fix when practicable.
5. Run the appropriate project scripts (e.g., `./scripts/lint`, targeted tests) to validate the fix.
6. Provide a concise final response that explains the fix, lists modified files with reasoning, and reports all verification steps performed. Call out any assumptions, risks, or follow-up tasks.

Constraints:
- Preserve existing behaviour and APIs unless modification is essential to the fix.
- Keep edits contained to relevant files; prefer targeted, well-documented changes.
- Avoid unrelated refactors or clean-up unless required to address the bug.

Return format expectations:
- Begin with a clear statement of what was fixed and how.
- Summarise file-by-file changes with rationale.
- Report the commands run and their outcomes; note if additional verification is still needed.
- Mention any open questions or remaining risks for the tester.
