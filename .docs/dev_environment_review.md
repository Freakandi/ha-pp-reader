# Development Environment Evaluation

## Environment settings overview
- The devcontainer image is pinned to `mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/python:3.13`, installs Home Assistant system build dependencies via the `apt-packages` feature, and runs `scripts/setup` followed by `python3 -m pip install --requirement requirements-dev.txt` after creation.【F:.devcontainer.json†L1-L41】
- The Codex setup script invoked by the environment also runs `scripts/setup_container`, which installs apt packages, creates/activates `.venv`, upgrades `pip`, and installs only the runtime requirements.【F:scripts/setup_container†L1-L28】

## Gaps impacting development & testing
- `scripts/setup_container` does not install the development requirements, so pytest and helper tooling are only available because the devcontainer post-create hook runs an additional installation; Codex environments that rely solely on the setup script will miss testing dependencies. Add `pip install --requirement requirements-dev.txt` to the script to make testing available everywhere.【F:scripts/setup_container†L1-L28】【F:requirements-dev.txt†L1-L4】
- The runtime requirements pin `homeassistant==2025.2.4` while `pytest-homeassistant-custom-component` pulls in `homeassistant==2025.10.0b4`. This version skew can introduce subtle import/runtime issues; align the versions or constrain `pytest-homeassistant-custom-component` to match the integration's target release.【F:requirements.txt†L1-L4】【F:requirements-dev.txt†L1-L4】
- Pytest currently fails because our local `tests` package masks the helper package from `pytest-homeassistant-custom-component`, making `tests.common` unavailable. Provide a shim module (e.g. `tests/common.py` that re-exports the upstream helpers) or adjust imports to reference `pytest_homeassistant_custom_component.common` directly so the suite can run in a clean environment.【F:tests/__init__.py†L1-L1】【9b98ba†L6-L43】

## Start log review
- No startup log was generated under `/root`, `/workspace`, or `/tmp`, so the Codex setup output appears to be discarded. If logging is desired, enable the "Log output" option or redirect the setup script output into a file for later inspection.【fa6082†L1-L1】

## Recommended configuration changes
1. Extend `scripts/setup_container` to install `requirements-dev.txt` and optionally run `pip install --upgrade pip` only once to avoid redundant upgrades (the runtime requirement on `pip>=21.3.1` already ensures a minimum version).【F:scripts/setup_container†L1-L28】【F:requirements.txt†L1-L4】
2. Ensure the Codex setup command list matches the devcontainer bootstrap (remove duplicate `./scripts/setup_container` entries, drop the nonexistent `./scripts/install_coverage` invocation, and source `.venv/bin/activate` only when executing follow-up commands).【F:scripts/setup_container†L1-L28】
3. Add a helper module so `tests.common` resolves, or switch imports to the canonical helper package. This change lives in the repo, but without it automated tests in Codex will continue to fail.【9b98ba†L6-L43】
