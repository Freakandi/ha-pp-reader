Codex, in the Portfolio Performance Reader repo at /workspaces/ha-pp-reader, start with the module attached module in custom_components/pp_reader. Make every Ruff violation in that module pass Ruff’s checks while keeping existing functionality, logging, and Home Assistant behavior intact. Explain each non-trivial fix and highlight any Ruff rule I can’t address without changing behavior. Run ./scripts/lint when you’re done and summarize the outcome, noting any follow-up I should handle.
