// Entry module to ensure a single specifier is used when importing the dashboard controller.
// This keeps the versioned module identifier in one place and avoids duplicate evaluations
// caused by mismatched cache-busting query parameters.
//
// The placeholder `__PP_READER_BUILD__` is rewritten by the build pipeline to match the
// hashed bundle generated by Vite. Until the build runs, the fallback specifier keeps using
// the legacy `dashboard.js` file so the panel remains functional for developers.
